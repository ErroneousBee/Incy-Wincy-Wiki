  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Dog walkers are always welcome, but please keep your dogs under control and on a lead if necessary.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">It is an offence not to clean up after your dog. However, please don’t go to the trouble of putting the poo in a bag, only to then throw the bag into the bushes!</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Please help us protect the Woods and wildlife by taking your litter home with you. Many thanks to the dog walkers, and others, who pick up other people’s litter.</span>

    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Please enjoy the wild flowers –  but remember that it’s an offence to pick them or dig them up. Leave them for everyone to enjoy.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Cycles are not allowed in the woods and neither is camping.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Please do not put down food for foxes.</span>
  </p>

    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Fires! – There have been instances of fires being lit in the woods which can potentially threaten the whole wood in dry conditions. Even smaller fires and BBQ’s can burn the ground, destroying any plants or seeds in that spot. Obviously a serious fire should be reported to the Fire Brigade at once on 999.</span>

  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The park and woodlands are managed by Mid Sussex District Council and are subject to Local Authority Bylaws. The site is regularly patrolled by the MSDC Park Rangers. You can report any problems to MSDC on 01444 477392.</span>
