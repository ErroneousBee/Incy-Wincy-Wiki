title: Getting Involved

Ashplats Conservation Group is a voluntary organisation that aims to promote practical conservation for the benefit of the countryside and wildlife.
 
The Group was formed by local residents keen to be involved in conserving and enhancing the varied habitats the wood affords, and promoting the benefits to local people.
  
We are affiliated to TCV (“The Conservation Volunteers”) who give helpful advice and support.
  
The Group generally meets on the 2nd Sunday of each month and carries out a variety of tasks including:
 
* Pond restoration
* Coppicing
* Control of invasive species (such as Rhododendron)
* Path and ride maintenance
* Glade creation and improvement
* Surveying and monitoring wildlife populations
    
We meet at 10:00am at the dark green shipping container half way down the road that crosses East Court and usually work until 3pm, but you’re welcome to leave earlier if you wish. In November the meeting is always on the 1st Sunday to avoid Remembrance Sunday.
    
Everyone is welcome, including children. Under 16’s though should be accompanied by an adult.
  
No experience is necessary and tools, gloves and training will be provided. It’s advisable to wear old clothes and stout boots.
  
Bring a packed lunch. This is your free gym – right on your doorstep! Come along and make new friends, learn new skills and make a difference – even if you can only make a few hours. It all helps.
