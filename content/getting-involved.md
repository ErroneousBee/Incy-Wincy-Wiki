    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Ashplats Conservation Group is a voluntary organisation that aims to promote practical conservation for the benefit of the countryside and wildlife.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The Group was formed by local residents keen to be involved in conserving and enhancing the varied habitats the wood affords, and promoting the benefits to local people.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">We are affiliated to TCV (“The Conservation Volunteers”) who give helpful advice and support.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The Group generally meets on the 2nd Sunday of each month and carries out a variety of tasks including:</span>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Pond restoration</span>
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>

    </li>

In November the meeting is always on the 1st Sunday to avoid Remembrance Sunday.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Everyone is welcome, including children. Under 16’s though should be accompanied by an adult.</span>
  </p>

    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">No experience is necessary and tools, gloves and training will be provided. It’s advisable to wear old clothes and stout boots.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Bring a packed lunch. This is your free gym – right on your doorstep! Come along and make new friends, learn new skills and make a difference – even if you can only make a few hours. It all helps.</span>
