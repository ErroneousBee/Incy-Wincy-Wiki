title: Test Setting class in Frontmatter
theme: woodland
class: wide
---

The frontmatter contained in this markdown file contains a line that sets the woodland theme, and also applies CSS class "wide" to the article.

Notice how this text runs right across the available space. The default ( for desktop ) is for a 60 character wide column.

Classes on the main article are reset when navigating between pages.
