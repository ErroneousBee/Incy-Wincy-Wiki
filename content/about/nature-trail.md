<span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">As a permanent reminder of the Girl-guiding Centenary celebrations (1910 &#8211; 2010), Guides in East Grinstead, with the support of many local organizations including Ashplats Conservation Group, have installed a nature trail in the gardens of East Court Mansion and Ashplats Wood.</span><figure id="attachment_168" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 707px">

<span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The trail is free for anyone to use. It’s about 1 mile long and will take the average adult about 30 minutes to walk. The information sign above can be found on the terrace of East Court Mansion and the photo left shows one of the posts on the trail. There are 16 posts in total and where possible these are sited near to paths to enable pushchairs, wheelchairs and those who are less steady on their feet to reach them. However, the path through the woods to Rutland Meadow is narrow, over rougher ground and will be muddy when wet.</span><figure id="attachment_169" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignright" style="width: 235px">

<span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">On top of each post is a beautiful brass plaque designed by a local artist Victoria Dewing. There are four groups of pictures depicting birds, flowers, animals and local places of interest. If you have time, why not collect a bag of paper and crayons (available from East Grinstead Tourism Office in the Library or East Grinstead Museum, or the Council Offices in East Court) and ‘brass rub’ the images so that you can take them home. You could challenge yourselves to remember all the pictures or count up how many legs there are in total. You may even be lucky enough to spot some of the creatures depicted on the plaques as you walk round.</span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Please use the trail as much and however you like &#8211; enjoy yourselves and have FUN.</span>
