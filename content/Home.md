# Welcome to the PortaWiki Pages

PortaWiki is a generator for small static websites. It is suitable for creating sites for small organizations. 

Its designed as a replacement for TiddlyWiki, and shares some design goals with Static Site Generators such as Hugo or Jekyll.

Design Goals:
* Simpler to get started than Hugo and Jekyll.
* A replacement for TiddlyWiki pages.
* Avoids the maintainence and hosting costs of WordPress and other database driven sites. 
* Navigation elements not automatically generated ( most site templates are aimed at blogging ).
* Uses standard markdown, and can be moved to other Markdown based site generators if requirements change.
* Plugin system for special treatment of markdown.
* No macro language for generating content. 
* Use industry standard tools ( VS Code, npm, markdown ).
* Suitable for use with netlify and other stsic site hosting services.
